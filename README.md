# MMR's Snapchat Cracking tutorial	-	*@MMR_776 ON TELEGRAM FOR MORE IN DEPTH TUTORIALS*

# Preface:
The key to these methods are relying on lots of information on the target. This includes full name, email, phone number, and any social media usernames or known screen names of the target. Using all of this information you can cross reference with the information you gain from the sites and services i will list to give you the best chance at hacking the target.
		
### Setting up your work-station:
*By workstation, I mean gathering the tools you will need to attempt this hack.*
		
-Purchase a subscription at one or all of the following sites:
		
For gathering more information on a target:
- https://snusbase.com/
> I primarily use this site for finding their email with the wildcard search and using instagrams "forgot password" feature to narrow down the results.
- https://www.beenverified.com/
> I use this site for a reverse lookup to potentially find their email or phone number
		
For finding passwords:
- https://leakpeek.com/
> one of the best sites for finding passwords associated with emails or a common username 
- https://dehashed.com/	(check the hashes on https://hashes.org/)
> lower tier than leakpeek, but i havent really used this site too much
				
### Testing passwords:
Please DO NOT try to log into an account from the app, you *WILL* trigger a suspcious login that will alert the target. Test all passwords on https://accounts.snapchat.com/accounts/login 
		> If after hitting the login button you are met with a blank screen, this does not mean the password worked. This is snapchat rate limiting the number of tries on the account. Take 15 or so minutes off that target and come back to it later.
		> If met with a two factor authenticaion code, you are shit outta luck, that shits impossible unless you sim swap (if you don't know what this is, don't look it up)
		> If met with a suspicious login screen or you have logged into the account, congrats, it worked!
		
### Bypassing Suspicious login:
*WARNING: THIS DOES NOT GUARENTEE THE BYPASS OF THE SCREEN, THIS IS ONLY A KNOWN METHOD THAT HAS WORKED FOR SOME*
		
When logging into the account on the app, sometimes connecting to a vpn is all that is needed to bypass the screen. But please do this with caution, because if it does not work the target will be alerted and change the password.
		
The most secure way is to purchase a "Bypass suspcious login" off my shoppy here https://shoppy.gg/@serviceesnap
